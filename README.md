## 🧠 Intelligent Task Tracking

**The mission control app now automatically tracks task completion!**

### How It Works:
1. **Commit in hauskat with task ID:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "HK-005: add multiplayer support"
   ```

2. **Mission Control automatically:**
   - Detects the commit
   - Matches to task HK-005
   - Shows confidence score
   - Updates progress
   - Creates audit trail

### Features:
- **Explicit Matching:** `HK-###:` in commit → 100% confidence
- **Keyword Matching:** Analyzes task keywords → 30-100% confidence
- **File Pattern Analysis:** Detects relevant file changes
- **AI Integration:** Claude Code reads `TASKS.md` and uses proper format
- **Real-time Updates:** File watching every 30s

### Documentation:
- `INTELLIGENT-TRACKING.md` - Full technical docs
- `SETUP.md` - Integration guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md` - Summary & test results
- `hauskat/TASKS.md` - Task registry
- `hauskat/CLAUDE.md` - Commit conventions
