# Quick Start Guide - Hauskat Mission Control Mac App

## You're All Set!

Your Hauskat Mission Control native Mac application has been successfully built and is ready to use!

## What Just Happened?

I've created a complete Electron-based Mac application from your React component with:

- **Native Mac app wrapper** using Electron
- **State persistence** - your progress is automatically saved
- **Beautiful UI** with Tailwind CSS
- **Production build** ready in the `release/` folder
- **All 17 sections** from your v4.5 component

## Ready to Use Now!

### Option 1: Install the App (Recommended)

1. **Open the DMG**:
   ```bash
   open "release/Hauskat Mission Control-4.5.0-arm64.dmg"
   ```

2. **Drag to Applications folder**

3. **Launch it**:
   - Right-click "Hauskat Mission Control.app"
   - Select "Open" (first time only, due to unsigned app)
   - Click "Open" in the security dialog

### Option 2: Run in Development Mode

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

This will:
- Start Vite dev server
- Launch the app with hot reload
- Open DevTools for debugging

## File Sizes

Your build created:
- **DMG installer**: 93 MB (ready to share!)
- **ZIP archive**: 90 MB (portable version)
- **Unpackaged app**: in `release/mac-arm64/`

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
npm run electron:dev    # Run with hot reload

# Building
npm run build          # Build production version
npm run package        # Create .app, .dmg, and .zip

# Preview
npm run preview        # Preview production build
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Run the App
Install the DMG and launch "Hauskat Mission Control" from Applications!

### 2. Customize the Icon (Optional)
The current icon is an SVG cat. To use a custom PNG:

```bash
# Create a 512x512 PNG icon
# Save it as: public/icon.png
# Rebuild: npm run package
```

### 3. Share the App
The DMG file in `release/` can be shared with others!

**Note**: The app is unsigned, so users will need to:
1. Right-click the app
2. Select "Open"
3. Confirm in the security dialog

### 4. Sign the App (Advanced)
For distribution, get an Apple Developer account and code signing certificate.

## Troubleshooting

### App won't open?
- Right-click > Open (don't double-click first time)
- Check System Settings > Privacy & Security

### State not saving?
- Check DevTools console for errors
- Try: `localStorage.clear()` and restart

### Build failed?
```bash
rm -rf dist dist-electron release node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

## What's Persisted?

The app automatically saves to localStorage:
- ✅ Completed checkboxes (`completedItems`)
- ✅ Active section (`activeSection`)
- ✅ Sidebar open/closed (`sidebarOpen`)
- ✅ Active phase (`activePhase`)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently available:
- `Cmd+Q`: Quit
- `Cmd+W`: Close window
- `Cmd+R`: Reload
- `Cmd+Option+I`: Toggle DevTools
- `Cmd+Plus/Minus`: Zoom in/out

## Support

- **Full documentation**: See `APP_README.md`
- **Issues**: Check DevTools console (Cmd+Option+I)
- **Reset data**: DevTools > Console > `localStorage.clear()`

## Success!

Your Hauskat Mission Control is now a native Mac application!

**Enjoy mission controlling!** 🐱🚀
