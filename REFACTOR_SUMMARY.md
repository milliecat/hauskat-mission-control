## Migration Guide

### For Developers:

If you have local changes to the old MissionControl.jsx:

1. The old file is backed up at `src/MissionControl.jsx.backup`
2. New architecture splits sections into `src/components/sections/`
3. State management is now in `src/hooks/useMissionControl.js`
4. Constants moved to `src/constants/sections.js`
5. Storage utilities in `src/utils/storage.js`

### Porting Old Section Content:

To add content from the backup to new sections:

1. Open `src/MissionControl.jsx.backup`
2. Find the section component code
3. Copy relevant JSX and logic
4. Paste into corresponding file in `src/components/sections/`
5. Update to use new props: `completedItems`, `onToggleComplete`
